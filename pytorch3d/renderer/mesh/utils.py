    Try to place rect within the current bounding box.
    Part of the implementation of pack_rectangles.

    Note that the arguments `placed_so_far` and `occupied` are modified.

    Args:
        rect: rectangle to place
        placed_so_far: the locations decided upon so far - a list of
                    (x, y, whether flipped). The nth element is the

    Example:
    (We always have placed the first rectangle horizontally and other
    rectangles above it.)
    Let's say the placed boxes 1-4 are layed out like this.
    The coordinates of the points marked X are stored in occupied.
    It is to the right of the X's that we seek to place rect.
