    Pointcloud rasterization

    Args:
        pointclouds: A Pointclouds object representing a batch of point clouds to be
            rasterized. This is a batch of N pointclouds, where each point cloud
            can have a different number of points; the coordinates of each point
            are (x, y, z). The coordinates are expected to
            be in normalized device coordinates (NDC): [-1, 1]^3 with the camera at
            (0, 0, 0); In the camera coordinate frame the x-axis goes from right-to-left,
            the y-axis goes from bottom-to-top, and the z-axis goes from back-to-front.
        image_size: Integer giving the resolution of the rasterized image
        points_per_pixel (Optional): We will keep track of this many points per
            pixel, returning the nearest points_per_pixel points along the z-axis
        bin_size: Size of bins to use for coarse-to-fine rasterization. Setting
            bin_size=0 uses naive rasterization; setting bin_size=None attempts to
            set it heuristically based on the shape of the input. This should not
            affect the output, but can affect the speed of the forward pass.
        points_per_bin: Only applicable when using coarse-to-fine rasterization
            (bin_size > 0); this is the maxiumum number of points allowed within each
            bin. If more than this many points actually fall into a bin, an error
            will be raised. This should not affect the output values, but can affect
            the memory usage in the forward pass.

    Returns:
        3-element tuple containing

        - **idx**: int32 Tensor of shape (N, image_size, image_size, points_per_pixel)
          giving the indices of the nearest points at each pixel, in ascending
          z-order. Concretely `idx[n, y, x, k] = p` means that `points[p]` is the kth
          closest point (along the z-direction) to pixel (y, x) - note that points
          represents the packed points of shape (P, 3).
          Pixels that are hit by fewer than points_per_pixel are padded with -1.
        - **zbuf**: Tensor of shape (N, image_size, image_size, points_per_pixel)
          giving the z-coordinates of the nearest points at each pixel, sorted in
          z-order. Concretely, if `idx[n, y, x, k] = p` then
          `zbuf[n, y, x, k] = points[n, p, 2]`. Pixels hit by fewer than
          points_per_pixel are padded with -1
        - **dists2**: Tensor of shape (N, image_size, image_size, points_per_pixel)
          giving the squared Euclidean distance (in NDC units) in the x/y plane
          for each point closest to the pixel. Concretely if `idx[n, y, x, k] = p`
          then `dists[n, y, x, k]` is the squared distance between the pixel (y, x)
          and the point `(points[n, p, 0], points[n, p, 1])`. Pixels hit with fewer
          than points_per_pixel are padded with -1.
